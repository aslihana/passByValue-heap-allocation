# passByValue-heap-allocation

All arguments in C are pass by value, like many other languages. However, memory allocation of C is usually “stack allocation”. 
Lots of OOP languages use “heap allocation”. This difference leads to ineffective updates that are targeted to assign arrays.

**This function tries use pointer arrays with heap allocation to provide OOP style pass by value in assigning array to array.**
